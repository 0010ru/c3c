# C3 Language

This is a prototype language branched off C2. It goes further than C2 in several regards, while still embracing the goals of C2.

As of now, very little code towards the compiler will be added here.

There is a "work-in-progress" C2 compiler in C called Titanos, which an eventual compiler might be based on.
