# C3 Language

C3 is a C-like language trying to be "an incremental improvement over C" rather than a whole new language. C3 is based on the ideas of the [C2 language](c2lang.org): to iterate on top of C without trying to be a whole new language.

C3 tries to be an alternative in the the C/C++ niche: fast and close to the metal.

### Design Principles
- Procedural "get things done"-type of language.
- Try to stay close to C - only change where truly needed.
- Flawless C integration.
- Learning C3 should be easy for a C programmer.
- Dare violating the "close to metal" principle if the value is great.
- Not an object oriented language.
- Avoid "big ideas".
- Avoid the kitchen sink language trap.

### Current status

Most work is still being done in the design draft here: https://c3lang.github.io/c3docs/. If you have suggestions, send a mail to [christoffer@aegik.com](mailto:christoffer@aegik.com), [file an issue](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/issues) or discuss C3 on the r/ProgrammingLanguages Discord server: https://discord.gg/cfu4wdk

There are some small work being done on the parser here, but most of the structure is still missing.

If you wish to contribute with ideas, please file issues on the c3docs: https://github.com/c3lang/c3docs instead of the compiler.
