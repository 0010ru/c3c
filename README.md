# C3 Language

This is a prototype language heavily inspired by C2. It goes further than C2 in several regards, while still embracing the goals of C2.

### Design Principles
- Procedural "get things done"-type of language.
- Try to stay close to C - only change where truly needed.
- Flawless C integration.
- Learning C3 should be easy for a C programmer.
- Dare violating the "close to metal" principle if the value is great.
- Not an object oriented language.
- Avoid "big ideas".
- Avoid the kitchen sink language trap.

### Current status

As of now, very little code towards the compiler will be added here.

There is a "work-in-progress" C2 compiler in C called Titanos, which an eventual compiler might be based on.
